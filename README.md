# Bar
A ***BAD*** gtk4 bar. **Don't use it** *;-;*. this little project teaches me a bit about async. I plan to rewrite the whole thing one day.

## What does it do?
- Display Hyprland Workspaces.
- Have a little MPD control.
- Volume control.
- Uses eww as systray cuz I'm too lazy.
- Kinda broken battery display.
- Ohh and it also turns transparent when there's no tiling window in the current workspace.
- What? That's not impressive? Fine.
- And it also freezes randomly for some reasons. Probably because of my bad async code.
